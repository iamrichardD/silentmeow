# Cache Implementation Specification

## Overview
This document describes the caching system implemented in the silentmeow project, focusing on in-memory caching with a focus on authentication token management.

## Design Goals
- Improve performance of frequently accessed data
- Enable immediate token invalidation for security purposes
- Protect sensitive information from being exposed in cache keys
- Provide a foundation for rate limiting and other security features

## Components

### Cache Service Interface
- Defines the core caching operations: get, set, delete, clear
- Generic type support for storing any data type
- TTL (Time To Live) support for automatic expiration

### Cache Key Generator
- Provides secure key generation to prevent PII exposure
- Special handling for user data to protect sensitive information
- Consistent key format for improved cache organization

### In-Memory Cache Implementation
- Thread-safe in-memory storage
- Automatic cleanup of expired items
- Configurable default TTL values

## Integration Points

### Token Service
- JWT token caching for improved validation performance
- Immediate token invalidation capabilities
- Refresh token management

### Authentication System
- Support for token verification without database queries
- Foundation for rate limiting of authentication attempts
- Session management capabilities

## Security Considerations
- No sensitive data stored in cache keys
- Automatic expiration of sensitive cached data
- Support for immediate invalidation of compromised tokens

## Future Enhancements
- Redis-based distributed cache implementation
- Token rotation capabilities
- Rate limiting for security-sensitive operations
- Metrics collection for cache performance
