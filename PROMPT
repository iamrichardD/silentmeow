silentmeow Project Specification

Project Overview
A comprehensive monorepo web application with advanced architectural considerations, focusing on performance, security, and modern web technologies.

Technical Specification

Tech Stack
Backend: 
- Node.js with TypeScript
- Express.js for REST API
- TypeORM for database interaction
- Jest for testing
- Winston for structured logging

Database: PostgreSQL

Frontend Architecture

1. WebAssembly (Rust) Implementation
- Rust for core business logic
- WebAssembly (Wasm) for performance-critical operations
- TypeScript for DOM manipulation
- Rust-Wasm bridge using wasm-bindgen

Wasm Module Responsibilities
- Data validation
- Cryptography
- Complex computations
- Local data processing
- State management

2. Offline-First Capabilities
- IndexedDB wrapper in Rust
- Local state management
- Data encryption/decryption
- Data compression
- Complex data transformations
- Binary data handling

3. Data Synchronization
- Queue management
- Conflict resolution
- Data versioning
- Binary diff/patch
- Data integrity checks

4. Progressive Enhancement
- Base HTML functionality
- Wasm feature detection
- Fallback to JavaScript
- Graceful degradation strategy
- Loading states during Wasm initialization

5. Build System
- wasm-pack for Rust compilation
- Cargo.toml configuration
- webpack/rollup integration
- Source maps support
- Development hot reload

6. Local Storage
- Custom IndexedDB implementation
- Efficient binary storage
- Data serialization/deserialization
- Storage quota management
- Cache management

7. User Experience
- Offline indicator
- Sync status notifications
- Loading states
- Error states
- Offline action queuing UI

8. Performance Optimization
- Asset optimization
- Critical CSS
- Lazy loading
- Resource prioritization
- Bundle optimization

Project Architecture
- Monorepo design
- Vertical Slice Architecture
- SOLID principles
- Repository pattern
- Domain-Driven Design

Logging
- Structured logging with Winston
- Log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- JSON formatted logs
- Context-rich logging
- Correlation IDs
- Custom log transports
- Environment-specific configurations

Host Server Log Management
- Log rotation via logrotate
- Time and size-based rotation
- Log compression
- Retention management
- Log file permissions
- System-level log aggregation

Monitoring and Metrics
Prometheus Integration
- Custom metrics collection
- Node.js default metrics
- Application performance metrics
- Business activity metrics

Metric Types
- Counters
- Gauges
- Histograms
- Summaries

Metric Labels
- Endpoint paths
- HTTP methods
- Response status codes
- Error types
- User roles

Features
1. User Authentication
- Login page
- Signup page
- Email-based login
- Password security
- Strength validation

2. Database
- PostgreSQL
- Migrations
- Soft delete
- Audit fields

3. Security
- Password hashing
- Secure data storage
- Best practice implementations
- JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication
- Stateless authentication mechanism

Authentication Strategy:
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure, stateless authentication
- Token-based authorization mechanism
- Secure token generation and validation
- Support for access and refresh tokens

JWT Token Characteristics:
- Short-lived access tokens (15-30 minutes)
- Long-lived refresh tokens (7-14 days)
- Cryptographically signed tokens
- Contains user identity and roles
- Supports fine-grained access control

Authentication Features:
- Secure token generation
- Token validation middleware
- Refresh token rotation
- Secure token storage
- Protection against common authentication vulnerabilities
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - Token replay attacks
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Comprehensive logging of authentication events

4. Configuration
- settings.json
- Environment-based config
- Structured logging

5. Docker Setup
- Docker Compose
- Container networking
- Volume management
- Environment variables
- Prometheus and Grafana services

6. Testing
- Comprehensive unit tests
- Mocked repositories
- Test utilities

7. Pages
- Home page
- Login page
- Signup page
- Resume page

Licensing
- Apache License 2.0
- Comprehensive attribution
- Copyright headers
- LICENSE and NOTICE files

Deployment Considerations
- AWS deployment readiness
- Containerization
- Scalable architecture
- Performance-optimized design

Additional Technical Notes
- Emphasis on modularity
- Focus on performance
- Security-first approach
- Comprehensive monitoring
- Flexible configuration
